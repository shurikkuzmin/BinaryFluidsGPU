General structure
-----------------

1. Introduction (the most important thing) we need to do all literature and
include all the articles - GPU without NN interaction, CUDA articles. Here to
mention that OpenCL is still something new and can perform differently and
then to tell the objective is to create really efficient algorithm for
multiphase models.
2. Lattice Boltzmann introduction. 
3. GPU algorithms.
4. Numerical results in terms of performance.
5. Conclusion

Shan-Chen vs. Free-energy
-------------------------
The models are different and include different equations of state and density
profiles. The only two things which come to my mind are:
1. to implement the same equation of state for both systems and to compare
bulk densities or density profiles. There is the paper which I attached for
reference for how to implement it with different EOSes. But I am not sure how
to implement it with multicomponent model - they are kind of completely
different.

2. It is the well known test which is usually failed by any multicomponent
model. If you have Poiseulle flow with different viscosities fluids and one
rho - you have one profile, if you have the same viscosity but different rho
there is analytical formulae to do it but many models fail. I can digg into it
and provide with literature. The test would be as like which model performs
better for this analytical solution. 

3. The one component multiphase models can be compared for sure for the same
equation of state.

Also, in one of Julia's papers there is a short paragraph comparing the two
models.  I will look it up and add it to the repo (michal).
